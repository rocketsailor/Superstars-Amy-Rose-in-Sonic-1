Originally I was also going to include the "whoosh" sfx that plays when you land and start doing the hammer rush.
However, it conflicts with both the bonk sfx and the drums in the music, so I decided to remove it and just reuse the sfx used for releasing a spindash (at least for now).

It's unfortunate that the new sfx interferes with the music a bit, but this was my best option for now. Maybe one day I'll try something different, or maybe I won't IDK LMAO.

Shoutout to vladikcomper for creating Mega PCM 2, it's seriously beyond impressive.

And to anybody who is actually reading this, you're cool :D
