Changes and Features
============
* You play as Amy (instead of Sonic, obviously)
  * Amy's sprites have been modified for a 15 color palette
  * Amy has her jumping hammer attack (press jump again in air to activate)
  * Note: Hammer Rush will NOT be added
  * Might add spindash if I feel like it sometime later
  * Might add custom sfx for the hammer attack (again, if I feel like it sometime later)
* Palette line 0 is changed, meaning various objects will have different colors
* HUD, title card and other things (hopefully monitors) will use yellow from palette line 1 instead of line 0
* No spike bug
* Press start button text displays on title screen
* There might be more stuff that I'm forgetting idk
